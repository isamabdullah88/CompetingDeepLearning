# ChasingDeepLearning
This repo chases Deep Learning in performance for object [logo] detection using classical Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

## Objectives:
- I am very interested in developing optimal code with classical techniques.
- In order to satisfy this, we want community to contribute their part in developing this repo.
- This repo strives to develop very high efficient and accurate code to do logo detection.
- You can use classical Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques.
- You can not use any deep learning techniques. e.g CNNs, Neural Network, RNN, GANs etc.
- Please contribute!
